# Alina's Personal Project: Pomodoro Task Organizer

## What will the application do?
The application I will be making for the personal project will be a Pomodoro timer application with an additional
task organizer. The application will have the following features;

- An editable pomodoro timer

<p> 
    The editable pomodoro allowing the timer 50 minutes of work and 10 minutes of break. The Pomodoro timer is a method 
of studying that allows the user to take breaks at allotted time intervals that promote focus and comprehension.
</p>

- Folders with individual todo lists

<p> 
Each folder having an editable title that allows the user to add tasks to a todo list under
a specific focus or idea. This will allow the user to create organization between tasks and break
big chucks of work into manageable pieces.
</p>

- A collective todo list with all the tasks from all the folders

<p>
the user will have the option of also having a 'master todo list' which will contain 
all the todo tasks from all the folders the user has.
</p>

## Who will use it?
With Covid and the emergence of many individuals needing to switch their 
schooling and work online this application will be used by people struggling to keep their 
focus on track while at home. Meaning the application will have a large demographic of people
who all struggle with focus while work on tasks over a long period of time.

## Why is this project of interest to you? 
I personally wanted to make something that I would be able to use after this course which is where the idea of the
pomodoro came from. I use many applications like this to keep track of my productivity but, they always 
have something that I don't like about the application. Although I find that the interface that I use 
has too many features which makes it more of a distraction than an aid in my productivity. So, this 
application I will take the aspects of each application that help and combine the elements that I like
into one application. The main interest in this specific project is born mostly from the chance in 
 making something practical for me that I know the people around me like my friends in school, friends doing full time
work, my parents and myself can use every day.
