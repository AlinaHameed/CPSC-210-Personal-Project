# Alina's Personal Project: Greenhouse Game

## What will the application do?
The application that I will be making for the personal project is similar to the idea of a 'desk pet' or
tamagotchi. Although instead of a pet, the user taking care of a pet it will be a plant within the Greenhouse game.
The user game will consist of the following;


- Taking care of a seedling

<p> 
    The user will be given a seedling and have the choice of what type of plant they want to take care of and can give
the plant a name. The user will then be able to water the plant to help it grow at reach the 'mature' stage.
</p>

- Sending off mature plants

<p> 
Once a plant reaches the mature state it is ready to leave the greenhouse into the real world! 
the user will be able to send off the plant the 'garden'. 
</p>

- Visiting the Garden

<p>
After sending a plant to a garden the user will also be prompted if they would like to visit the garden, when at the
visiting the garden the user can see how many of each type of plant has been sent to the garden.  
</p>

## Who will use it?
The demographic is similar to that of the tamagotchi wherein it is a game that appeals to people with a nurturing
instinct, in this case the urge to care for something and be able to see its growth and development and will lead into
seeing the development of the garden. Aside from people who enjoy nurture appeal games, parents can give this application to
their children to teach them the reward of taking care of something.

## Why is this project of interest to you? 
One of my hobbies outside of academics is gardening and, I also work at a florist shop. So a big part of my job
is centered around the premise of the game. I raise plants and flowers until they are mature and can be sold to 
customers can take them to their gardens. Although I notice some people find it difficult to take care of actual plants so,
the digitalization will allow people to still have the satisfaction of taking care of plants despite not having a green thumb.
